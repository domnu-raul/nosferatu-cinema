Nosferatu Cinema is a fictional cinema for which I built a website for. The homepage displays movies that
will be screened in the coming week. Visitors can check all screening schedules on the movies page, and
they can also filter by selecting a specific movie. Although creating an account and logging in doesnâ€™t
provide additional features on the site, an admin user gains access to the dashboard page, where they can
add or remove movies and screenings from the database. The project makes use of data from the TMDB
API, which provides movie data such as titles, runtimes, and other information.

This is a school project, for more information view the [documentation](https://github.com/domnu-raul/nosferatu-cinema/blob/main/documentation-tex/documentation.pdf).
